# 1. Introduction

## A. Purpose of the system

The purpose of the system is to provide the user with a social news website similar to Reddit. The social news network allows users to post articles related to computer science and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, it allows registered users to create their own posts and participate in discussions by leaving replies on other people's posts and comments. 

## B. Scope of the system

The idea is to build a system that should mimic a number of selected functionalities of https://hackernews.com. A full list of features will be provided further down. 

## C. Objectives and success criteria of the project

1. The system should be available to anyone with an internet connection and a browser from a publicly visible server
2. The system should have an uptime of at least 95% over the course of a 2 month period
3. The system should be able to retrieve messages, even when the backend and database is down.

## D. Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations

**Karma** - A user is rated with karma points which is earned when a user's article is either up or down voted. Each up vote increases points and down votes decreases points.

## E. References

Our primary reference is the assignment description supplied to us in the Large Systems Development class, located on the GitHub repository dedicated to the subject.

## F. Overview

The project will be focused on the description supplied to us, and will be worked on iteratively through the various assignments we will be given throughout the semester. While we do not have a current system to describe aside from the application we are supposed to imitate, we will have functional and nonfunctional requirements detailed for our proposed system.

# 2. Current System

There is currently no system in place, as this is a student project, and not a solution intended to replace any current systems.

# 3. Proposed System

## A. Overview

Our system will resemble the HackerNews website and include all of its basic features eg. posting articles, commenting, up-down voting, spam-flagging and karma ratings . The system will have a basic web based GUI which will be easy to use.

## B. Functional requirements

- Web based application
- All users can read content
- Registered users can post/comment on/up-vote/spam-flag articles
- Registered users with a karma score of 500+ can down vote articles
- All content must be persisted in a database
- All articles must be time stamped
- The system has to have a REST API

## C. Nonfunctional requirements

### a. Usability

The system will be a clone of Hackernews, and as such must have a simple graphical user interface that can be operated through most modern browsers. The simplicity of the graphical user interface is key, as we do not presume user familiarity with any similar systems, and will not be providing any sort of training in its usage.

The system must provide error messages to the user if an error has occurred, with a descriptive message to inform the user what went wrong. 

The system must present the different stories that have been posted in an orderly, compact yet understandable manner. 

The comments on any given story, along with the nested comments, must be presented with proper formatting and indentation to make a comment thread easy to follow and read.

### b. Reliability

After going live, the system must have a minimum uptime of 95%. Along with the system uptime, whenever the system does have downtime, whether it be unplanned or due to maintenance, there must be a mechanism in place that will cache incoming content, which will then forward the buffered content to the system once it has gone live again.

We do not expect for the system to be incredibly popular, so we have fairly low expectations for concurrent user numbers.

### c. Performance

The system will handle all incoming messages as soon as possible. There will be no data loss, and in case of server up-time, messages received in this period will be posted as soon as the system is up and running in a prioritized FIFO manner.

As the system is a leisure-based product, the level of criticality is fairly low. Still, the system should be rather responsive, as the application itself is fairly simple, and other products of the same type are pretty responsive.

### d. Supportability

The system must be properly documented, such that post-release maintenance can be performed in a cost-effective manner. There must be proper test documentation and regression suites, such that additions and changes can be performed more efficiently.

Maintenance of the system is handled by the development team. The team that receives the system will be able to report errors as issues on the GitHub repository.

### e. Implementation

The hardware platform will be a remote server operated by a third party company, and as such, neither the development team nor the users will have complete control over the server. As such, if the platform wherein the server is located has issues, the development team will not be capable of restoring the system until those issues have been resolved.

### f. Interface

The system will two different interfaces; a web-based application with a GUI, operable by normal users who wish to use the system, and a REST API that will allow an external program to publish stories and comments to the system without operating the GUI.

### g. Packaging

The system will be installed on a remote server by the development team, after which the address and any required credentials are handed over to the users, along with the location of the project's repository, such that they can establish issues found in the system that must be corrected.

### h. Legal

The system will be published on GitHub under the MIT license. The development team is fully responsible for system failures, and are required to correct failures in a timely manner.

# 4. Glossary

**Karma rating:** A user is rated with karma points which is earned when a user's article is either up or down voted. Each up vote increases points and down votes decreases points.
